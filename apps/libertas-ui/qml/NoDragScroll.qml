/// Wheel scrolling for a Flickable that cannot be dragged.
///
/// Nothing in this application scrolls by being dragged (ADR-0039). A list in a studio tool is
/// a list of things to *grab* -- a source to reorder, a strip to ride, a scene to take -- and a
/// surface that moves under the pointer when you pull on it will eventually move while someone
/// is trying to pull on what is in it. Setting `interactive: false` is what turns that off, and
/// in Qt it turns the wheel off with it: Flickable::wheelEvent returns early when the flickable
/// is not interactive. So the wheel has to be given back, and this is where.
///
/// Declared inside the Flickable with no arguments -- a pointer handler's `parent` is the item
/// it was declared in, which is the thing to scroll.
///
/// A control inside one of these that wants the wheel for itself -- a fader being trimmed --
/// declares its own WheelHandler. Qt offers a wheel to handlers from the innermost item
/// outward, so the deeper one wins and this never sees it. A MouseArea's `onWheel` does *not*
/// win that contest, which is why MixerFader uses a handler rather than its MouseArea.
