/// It takes the hovering MouseArea rather than the item being described, and that is the whole
/// fix for how this used to behave. The first version positioned itself from
/// `anchorItem.mapToItem(parent, 0, 0)` -- which reads like a binding and is not one. `mapToItem`
/// is a function call over values QML does not watch, so it was evaluated once, when the panel
/// was built and before anything had been laid out, and never again. Every tooltip in the
/// program therefore sat wherever its button had been at construction time, which was the
/// top-left corner; and for panels that genuinely live near the top, `y - height - 4` went
/// negative and the tooltip rendered off the window entirely. That is why the scenes panel
/// appeared to have no tooltips at all while other panels merely had misplaced ones.
///
/// `mouseX`/`mouseY` are notifying properties, so reading them here is a real binding that
/// re-evaluates as the pointer moves.
