# Run the headless self-check against a project directory that did not exist a moment ago.
#
# `--project` opens a directory when one is there, so the check used to inherit whatever the
# last run left -- including projects written by an older schema. That produced failures with
# no relationship to the change under test, and the habit of deleting the directory by hand
# before every run. One line of CMake is cheaper than remembering.
