# ADR 0010 — Modifier negotiation: the real cause, and two more failure modes

- **Status:** accepted. Supersedes ADR-0009's conclusion about the *primary* cause.
- **Date:** 2026-10-12
- **Target:** development box, Hyprland 0.56.2 (Aquamarine), portal-hyprland 1.4.1,
  PipeWire 1.6.8, NVIDIA 610.57.04, RTX 5080 + Intel UHD 770, capture source DP-1

## Context

ADR-0009 concluded that `no more input formats` was caused by a **phantom node id returned by a
restored session**. That is a real failure and is documented below, but it was not the main cause.
Pinning the output and dumping the source's offered formats at the moment of failure — both
diagnostics that should have existed from the first hour — made the actual bug visible immediately.

## Cause 1: we parsed the modifier with the wrong API, and the wrong answer was a valid modifier

`spa_format_video_raw_parse()` cannot reduce a modifier property that is still an unfixated
`CHOICE_Enum` — which is exactly the state the mandatory two-round dance leaves it in. It does not
fail; it leaves `info.info.raw.modifier` at **0**.

**0 is `DRM_FORMAT_MOD_LINEAR`.** So a failed parse is indistinguishable from the server having
chosen LINEAR, and the code went on to fixate LINEAR with every appearance of success:

```
info  negotiated 2560x1440 BGRA (drm AR24) modifier LINEAR fps 0/1
info  fixating modifier LINEAR for BGRA
info  stream state paused -> error: no more input formats
```

The source never offered LINEAR at all. Measured, for DP-1:

| | modifiers |
|---|---|
| source offers | `0x300000000606010`–`015`, `0x300000000e08010`–`015`, `INVALID` — **no LINEAR** |
| this device can import | `0x300000000606010`–`015`, `LINEAR` |
| real intersection | `0x300000000606010`–`015` — six usable modifiers |
| what we fixated | `LINEAR` — not offered, rejected |

So negotiation was failing on a modifier the compositor had never mentioned, while six mutually
supported modifiers sat unused. Every earlier "it works" run had `DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` in the
advertised list, which is a wildcard and masks this entirely — which is why the bug survived a
proven stage 2.

**Required:** read the property yourself with `spa_pod_get_values()`, take every value in the
choice, and select by intersecting against the modifiers the Vulkan device reports as importable.
A single `uint64` read of a modifier property is a bug, not a shortcut. Never let a parse failure
fall through to a default, because in this API the default is a legal value.

After the fix, negotiation is correct and the stream reaches `streaming` for the first time:

```
info  server offers 2560x1440 BGRA (drm AR24) fps 0/1 with 6 modifier(s), unfixated
info  fixating modifier NVIDIA(0x300000000606015) for BGRA
info  stream state paused -> streaming
```

## Cause 2: a compositor advertises modifiers it cannot allocate with

`0x300000000606015` negotiates, fixates, and reaches `streaming` — then delivers **zero frames**
and errors. The compositor's own fixed preference, from the source's single-valued `EnumFormat[0]`,
is `0x300000000606014`.

This is ADR-0007's accept-then-fail trap occurring one stage later than expected: not at import,
but at the compositor's own buffer allocation. A negotiated modifier is therefore **not** a working
modifier, and no amount of up-front intersection can establish that it is.

**Required:** the fallback ladder has to be a loop, not a promise. On a post-fixation failure, drop
the modifier that was actually fixated, retry on the same session, and degrade through the
remaining candidates to LINEAR and then to shm. Log every rung: silently taking a slower path is
how performance problems become unexplainable. Implemented in `stream_once`.
**Not yet proven** — see Open below.

## Cause 3: readiness is necessary but not sufficient

ADR-0009's phantom node is real, and it has a second form that the readiness probe cannot catch. A
restored session returned node 403 — the node from the *previous* run — which was still in the
registry, still answered a format query, and had **0 `EnumFormat` params** by the time the stream
connected. It was gone from the graph entirely minutes later.

So a node can pass `pw_probe_node` and be a corpse. **The only proof a capture session works is
frames flowing through it.** Acquisition therefore takes the real stream attempt as its final
validation step: a restored session that fails in use has its token discarded and falls back to a
fresh picker session, rather than surfacing a capture error.

Amendment to ADR-0009: a restore token is persisted once its session is **validated**, not once
frames have flowed. Validation already rules out the phantom case, and the two facts are different
— the token records that the user authorised this source, whereas frames flowing tests our own
pipeline. A modifier bug of ours must not cost the user a picker click.

## Cause 4 (confounder): the compositor's capture state degrades across sessions

After roughly six sessions in one sitting, **even a freshly picked source** yields a node with 0
`EnumFormat` params and `param_changed` never fires. Closing sessions properly (ADR-0009) reduces
this but does not eliminate it. Restarting
`xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland.service xdg-desktop-portal.service`, or rebooting, clears it.

**Consequence for method:** a long debugging session silently changes the thing being measured.
Any negative result after several runs must be re-confirmed on a clean portal before it is
believed, and the real worker must treat "node with no formats" as a retryable environment fault
rather than a configuration error.

## Open

- The fallback ladder is **written and compiles but has never engaged** — the run that would have
  exercised it hit Cause 4 instead. First thing to do on a clean session.
- Stage 3 (Vulkan dmabuf import) is still **unproven**: no frame has yet reached `vk_import.cpp`.
  Negotiation now yields a modifier the device claims it can import, so the import is next.
- Whether `0x300000000606014` (the compositor's own preference) works where `015` did not, which
  would say the ladder should be ordered by the source's `EnumFormat[0]` hint rather than by the
  order Vulkan happens to enumerate modifiers in.
