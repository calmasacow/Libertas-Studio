# ADR 0014 — Capture cards: pick the format for the output rate, not the peak rate

- **Status:** accepted, measured
- **Date:** 2026-10-12
- **Extends:** ADR-0013 (capture is damage-driven)
- **Hardware:** Elgato 4K X on `argus`, fed from the dev box's HDMI-A-1

## Context

A capture card is the second kind of video source, and it behaves nothing like the screen-capture
backend. ADR-0013 established that `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` is damage-driven and therefore
variable-rate. A card is the opposite: it has its own crystal and produces frames whether or not
anything changed. Everything below was measured rather than assumed, because the card's own
reporting is unreliable — it presents as a generic UVC camera, reports input `Status: ok` with no
cable attached, and does not implement `QUERY_DV_TIMINGS`.

The signal on the wire during these measurements: **2560x1440 @ 120.171 Hz, 8-bit sRGB RGB
(`XRGB8888`), HDR disabled**, mirroring DP-1.

## Finding 1: only one format exceeds 60 fps at 1440p

`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS` per pixel format at 2560x1440:

| format | 4:4:4? | range | max rate offered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NV12` 4:2:0 8-bit | no | limited | **144 / 120** / 60 / 59.94 / 50 / 30 |
| `BGR3` 24-bit BGR | **yes** | **full** | 60 / 59.94 / 50 |
| `YUYV` 4:2:2 | no | — | 60 / 59.94 / 50 |
| `P010` 4:2:0 10-bit | no | — | 60 / 59.94 / 50 |

So the high frame rates are bought entirely with colour. There is no 1440p120 path that is not
4:2:0, and no 10-bit path above 60.

## Finding 2: the card converts, and the conversion is lossy twice over

The source sends full-range 4:4:4 sRGB RGB. What comes back depends on the format asked for, and
the difference is directly visible in the sample statistics:

```
NV12 @120 : luma (plane 0): mean 82.58  min 16  max 229   -> limited range
BGR3 @60  : plane 0       : mean 83.53  min  0  max 240   -> full range
```

`min 16` versus `min 0` is the whole story. In NV12 the card has compressed full-range RGB into
limited-range Rec.709 **and** thrown away three quarters of the chroma. For a desktop source that
is the worst possible trade: 4:2:0 subsampling lands directly on text edges, and the range
compression discards code values that then have to be expanded again downstream.

Note also that V4L2 reports this stream as `Colorspace: sRGB` with `Transfer Function: Rec. 709` —
two different transfer curves named in one format description. The card's own metadata cannot be
trusted to drive colour conversion; the pipeline must be told what the source is.

## Finding 2b: the device declares a conversion it does not perform

Range is a *request* in V4L2: a client may ask for `V4L2_QUANTIZATION_FULL_RANGE`. Asking this
device for it produces the worst possible outcome — not a refusal, but a false acceptance:

```
NV12, requested full range
  colour        : sRGB / BT.709 / Rec.709 / quantization full
  luma (plane 0): mean 82.59  min 16  max 229
  range         : declared full, observed limited (luma inside [16,235])
```

The driver echoes `full` back in the format reply and then delivers limited-range pixels anyway.
A client that compares the reply to the request sees agreement and concludes the conversion
happened. This is the same shape as the modifier trap of ADR-0010: **accepted, then not honoured.**

Only the pixels can catch it. The spike now cross-checks the declared range against observed luma
extrema and warns when they disagree, which is a cheap and reliable test: limited range clamps
luma into `[16,235]`, full range does not.

Note also the metadata is internally inconsistent — `Colorspace: sRGB` with
`Transfer Function: Rec.709` are two different transfer curves named in one description.

## Finding 3: three clocks, and a drop no counter can see

Measured over 60 s / 7200 frames of NV12 @120:

```
driver gap    : mean 8.334 ms (119.99 fps)  p50 8.333  p99 8.411  max 11.145
measured rate : 119.9860 fps over 60.00 s
driver seq    : 0..7199, 0 break(s), 0 frame(s) never delivered to us
```

The card does not genlock. It free-runs at **119.986 fps** against a source presenting
**120.171 Hz** and samples whatever is on the wire. The capture path itself is clean — zero
sequence breaks over 7200 frames means we never once fell behind the driver.

But the two rates differ by 0.185 fps, so roughly **one source frame in every 650 is never
sampled** — one every 5.4 s, about 5300 over an eight-hour show. And `driver seq` reports no gaps
at all, because it counts frames the **card** produced, not frames the **source** sent. The loss
happens upstream of the counter entirely.

This extends ADR-0013 rather than contradicting it. There, the lesson was that inter-arrival time
measures content, so trust the producer's timestamp. Here, even the producer's own counter is
blind, because the producer is not the origin. Confirming such a drop directly requires a counter
rendered into the source image; it cannot be observed from inside V4L2.

## Finding 4: a reproducible ~680 ms stall when asking for 144

```
run 1: p50 6.944  p99 7.287  max 669.167   -> 123.99 fps average
run 2: p50 6.944  p99 6.966  max 682.405   -> 129.94 fps average
```

`p50 6.944 ms` is exactly 144.000 fps, and with the single stall excluded the card sustains it.
The stall reproduces run to run and drags the average down by 14-20 fps. A capture worker must
therefore treat a multi-hundred-millisecond gap at stream start as normal rather than as a hang,
and must never let it stall the show.

Separately, startup black is **2-4 frames** of `Y=0` before real content, and the count varies run
to run. The settle window is a measurement, not a constant — and no signal verdict may be taken on
frame 0.

## Finding 5: at 2160p there is no full-range 4:4:4 option at all

The 1440p trade is a choice. At 4K it is not:

| format | 3840x2160 max rate |
|---|---|
| `NV12` 4:2:0 limited | **60 / 59.94** |
| `YUYV` 4:2:2 | 50 / 30 |
| `P010` 4:2:0 10-bit | 30 / 29.97 |
| `BGR3` 4:4:4 full range | **none offered** |
| `MJPG` (lossy, compressed) | 144 / 120 |

So 4K60 has exactly one uncompressed path, and it is 4:2:0 limited range. The MJPG rates are
advertised only because compression hides the bandwidth; they are not a quality option.

This is worth stating plainly because it inverts the usual intuition: **capturing at 1440p60
yields better colour than capturing at 4K60**, since only the former has a full-range 4:4:4 path.
Resolution is not the only axis of quality, and for desktop and text content chroma resolution
often matters more than pixel count.

## Decision

**Select the capture format from the configured output rate, not from the card's peak capability.**

For this show, which encodes 1440p60 to YouTube and 1080p60 to Twitch, that means **`BGR3` @ 60**:

```
driver gap    : mean 16.667 ms (60.00 fps)  p50 16.666  p99 16.771  max 16.797
measured rate : 60.0008 fps   driver seq: 0..299, 0 break(s)
dmabuf export : yes (zero-copy possible)
SIGNAL        : PRESENT (full range)
```

Full-range 4:4:4 RGB, no chroma loss, no range round-trip, a 16.797 ms worst case over 300 frames,
and `VIDIOC_EXPBUF` works — so the zero-copy path is available here too, not only for NV12.
Choosing NV12 @120 would cost all of that colour fidelity to deliver frames that get decimated to
60 before they are ever encoded.

The general rule: **capturing above the output rate is only worth its colour cost when the extra
frames survive to the output.** They do not here.

Consequences for the implementation:

1. The V4L2 source negotiates format against the *output* configuration, and the UI must surface
   the trade (`1440p120 4:2:0 limited` vs `1440p60 4:4:4 full`) rather than silently maximising
   frame rate.
2. **Range, matrix and transfer are user-settable configuration, not detection.** This is forced by
   Finding 2b, not merely preferred: the device's metadata is self-contradictory *and* actively
   false, so there is nothing to detect from. Libertas applies the range conversion itself, in its
   own shader, from an explicit setting — with a sensible default and a visible override, the way
   OBS's V4L2 source exposes Color Range and Color Space.
3. Observed luma extrema are a useful *cross-check* on that setting, and the source should warn
   when the pixels contradict the configuration rather than silently producing crushed blacks.
4. Every source carries its own clock. Neither the card's nor the compositor's is the encoder's,
   and audio remains the master clock.
5. A rate mismatch between source and card is silent and unobservable from V4L2. Where it matters,
   match the output mode to the capture rate at the *source* — driving HDMI-A-1 at 60 Hz rather
   than 120.171 Hz removes the drift rather than compensating for it.
6. Capture-card sources are fixed-rate and must not reuse the damage-driven assumptions of
   ADR-0013.
