# ADR 0021 — Layout is workspace state, with its own library and its own undo stack

- **Status:** accepted, implemented
- **Date:** 2026-10-12
- **Implements:** ADR-0015 (the UI owns its layout), ADR-0016 (Adobe drop zones)
- **Amends:** ADR-0015 rule 6, and the repo tree in the plan

## Why this exists

ADR-0015 and ADR-0016 specified the behaviour. Building it forced six decisions they did not
cover, and one of them is a correction to ADR-0015 itself. They are recorded here rather than in
commit messages because each one will look arbitrary to whoever reads the code next.

## 1. `libs/llayout/` is its own library, and the plan's tree is wrong about this

The plan puts the document model in `libs/ldoc/` and does not mention a layout library, which
implies layout belongs in the document. It does not.

A document is the show: scenes, sources, buses, canvases, outputs. It is what gets shared, copied
between machines, imported from an OBS collection and version-controlled by the careful. A layout
is how *this* operator has arranged *this* installation's panels. Putting them in one file means a
project opened on the streaming rig rearranges the editing machine's workspace, and a project
shared with someone else carries a layout built for a triple-head desk.

So layout is **workspace state**: separate library, separate file, no dependency on `ldoc`. It
also means the layout engine is testable without a document model existing, which is why it exists
first.

## 2. Layout gets its own undo stack — ADR-0015 rule 6 was too broad

ADR-0015 rule 6 says "layout is a command like any other, so rearranging panels is undoable". The
first half of that is now wrong and the second half is right.

Adobe — the model the operator asked for — does not put workspace changes in the history panel.
The reason is worth stating: if rearranging a panel and deleting a scene share one undo stack,
Ctrl+Z stops being a keystroke the operator can press without looking first. Mid-show that is the
difference between a safe reflex and a gamble.

`llayout::History` is therefore a separate, bounded, snapshot-based stack. Snapshots rather than
inverse commands because a layout tree is a few dozen nodes — cheaper than the bookkeeping, and
incapable of drifting out of step with the thing it describes, which is what makes undo stacks
untrustworthy in the first place.

**Which keystroke gets it, decided when both stacks existed:** `Ctrl+Z` is the *document's* undo,
because that is what it is in every other application and an operator should never have to work
out which stack it will reach. The layout stack keeps its own binding (`Ctrl+Alt+Z`). Separating
the stacks is what made that choice available at all — with one stack there is no choice, only a
gamble. It is also how Premiere and After Effects treat a workspace change.

Two consequences that matter in use:

- A gesture that changed nothing does not spend a step. Otherwise Ctrl+Z after a mis-aimed drag
  appears to do nothing, the operator presses it again, and the second press undoes real work.
- A divider drag is **one** step, not one per mouse move.

## 3. Nearest-edge hit testing, which is provably ADR-0016's partition

ADR-0016 writes the four outer zones as inequalities on normalised `u, v`. The implementation
instead picks the nearest edge. These are the same partition: if `v < u` and `v < 1-u` then
`v < min(u, 1-u) ≤ 0.5 = 1-v`, so the nearest-edge test adds nothing the diagonals had not already
imposed.

Nearest-edge is used because it resolves the **corners**, where two zones meet at a single point.
The four inequalities name no zone there at all, so an implementation of them falls through to
whichever branch happens to be last — which is how `(0, 1)` ends up reported as `Right`. A test
sweeps the panel and asserts the two formulations agree on every point where the ADR's strict
inequalities name a zone.

Ties break horizontally. At an exact corner either answer is defensible; side docking is the more
common gesture in a video application, which wants tall columns.

## 4. Docking along the parent's own axis inserts a sibling instead of nesting

A drop on the left of a panel whose parent is already a horizontal split takes half of that
panel's slot and becomes its sibling. It does not create a nested horizontal split inside the
slot.

Without this, every dock adds a level. The tree grows without bound under ordinary use, and —
visibly — the dividers stop lining up with each other, because a nested split's divider is
positioned within its parent's slot rather than across the row. Twelve docks along one axis now
leave the tree four levels deep.

The same rule, applied at the root, is what makes an edge dock produce a full-height column rather
than a column nested inside a row.

## 5. Every mutation runs on a copy and commits only if it validates

ADR-0016 rule 8 asks for refused drops. The harder requirement is that a refused drop changes
*nothing*, and the hardest bug this code can have is a half-applied tree mutation — a dangling
child, a fraction vector of the wrong length, a panel in two groups at once.

So `dock()` clones the tree, detaches, normalises, inserts, normalises again, runs `validate()`,
checks minimum-size feasibility, and only then commits. Cloning a twenty-node tree costs nothing
and the property test gets to assert, after every one of several thousand random gestures, that a
rejection left the layout byte-identical.

## 6. `resolve()` adapts the geometry; it never rewrites the fractions

When a window gets too small for a split's children, the obvious move is to rewrite the fractions.
That is the wrong one: the operator set those proportions and would find them silently changed on
the next launch, which is indistinguishable from the "randomly rearranging things" this project
exists to stop.

Instead the fractions stay the operator's **intent** and `resolve()` water-fills against the
minimum sizes — hand out by fraction, pin anyone below their minimum, redistribute the rest. Make
the window bigger and the original proportions come back exactly, because they were never lost.

## 7. QML singletons, not context properties

The shell initially injected `workspace` and `theme` as context properties. `qmllint` then flagged
every single access to them as unqualified, and it was right to: a context property is invisible
to the linter and to the QML compiler, so a mistyped property name is a runtime warning in a log
nobody reads rather than a build failure.

Declaring both as `QML_ELEMENT QML_SINGLETON` types makes the whole shell statically checked and
compilable. `qmllint` now reports nothing at all, which means it will be worth running again.

## 8. The self-check has to look at pixels, because two bugs lived where it was not looking

The first version of the shell's `--check` drove every gesture through the real engine, asserted
thirty-two things, and passed. The window it was checking rendered an empty rectangle.

**The first bug.** Panels reached QML as a count plus an indexed accessor, with each delegate's
binding written as

```qml
panel: {
    Workspace.revision;              // intended: a dependency, so this re-evaluates
    return Workspace.panelAt(index);
}
```

`Workspace.revision;` is a statement with no effect, so it is exactly the kind of thing a compiler
may delete — and the QML compiler deleted it. The delegates were created once, at a viewport of
0x0 (a zero-size window still has six panel groups; they are all zero-size), and never updated.
Every number the check asked for was right, because the engine was right; nothing had told the
scene graph.

The fix is not a cleverer way to spell the dependency. It is `QAbstractListModel`, which does not
depend on a side effect surviving optimisation. It resets only when the row *count* changes, and
otherwise emits `dataChanged` for the rows that actually moved — so a divider drag updates
geometry in place and the delegates stay alive, which was the requirement that produced the hack
in the first place.

**The second bug**, found by the same check once it was grabbing frames: the drop highlight has
`Behavior` animations on its geometry so it glides between zones. On *first* appearance those
animations grew it out of a zero-size rectangle at the origin — so for the first seventy
milliseconds of every drag, the operator was shown nothing at all where the panel was going to
land. Animations are now disabled until one frame after the highlight appears.

So `--check` now grabs the window and counts repainted pixels: the highlight must fill the region
the engine named, the wireframe must reach the rest of the target, and **no other panel may be
repainted at all** — measured at 0.00%, which matters because the wireframe is two full-length
diagonals drawn in a Shape that fills the whole workspace, and a drag overlay bleeding onto the
neighbours would make the gesture ambiguous exactly when it has to be clear.

The general lesson is the one ADR-0019 already recorded about instrumentation, in a new costume:
a test that only asks the component under test what it thinks will agree with it. Something has to
look at the output.

## What this bought, measured

- `llayout` is 4 source files and has no dependency on Qt, a compositor, or a window.
- 73 cases across 5 binaries, including two property tests that drive several thousand random
  gestures and assert every invariant after each one.
- One engine bug found that only a property test finds: dropping a panel onto its own tab group's
  centre reported `NoOp` while having brought that tab to the front. Structure unchanged is not
  the same as nothing changed, and a UI trusting that status would have skipped both the repaint
  and the undo entry.
- The shell has a `--check` mode that loads the real QML tree, drives the real gestures through
  the real engine, grabs the rendered frames and writes a real layout file, without showing a
  window. It forces the offscreen platform, so on a live session it cannot reach a display even
  by accident.
- Verified on both machines: the dev box and `argus`, the reference target (ADR-0008), which
  builds with Makefiles and has no ninja. Six tests, no warnings, on both.

## Still open

- **Tear-out to a floating window**, deferred by the operator until the docked model is complete
  (ADR-0016). The engine already supports a detached tree per toplevel; what is missing is the
  gesture and the `xdg_toplevel_tag_manager_v1` tagging.
- **Panel contents.** Everything inside a panel is a placeholder that says so. Drawing convincing
  fake meters would make it impossible to tell later which parts actually work.
- ~~**Keyboard-only docking.**~~ Done. `Layout::neighbour` answers "what is drawn to the left",
  geometrically rather than structurally -- a tree-walking answer would skip past a panel that is
  visibly adjacent because it lives in a different branch, which is not what anyone means. On top
  of it the shell has focus, directional focus movement, moving a panel one step in a direction,
  grouping it with a neighbour, and docking it to a workspace edge: eighteen actions in the
  registry, the navigation ones bound by default. The property that makes it usable -- repeatedly
  stepping one way terminates rather than cycling -- is a test.
