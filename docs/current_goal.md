# Where the work is, and what is next

## Text worker startup, 2026-10-21

Text workers eagerly constructed QMediaPlayer and QVideoSink, triggering CUDA
device probes in every process. A 16-worker startup probe took about 21 seconds,
exceeding the five-second handshake deadline and leaving sources blank until an
edit recreated their worker. Both media objects now initialize only for media
and playlist sources; the same probe completes in 309-375 ms. Failed workers retry
after three seconds, with stop-aware backoff. Real-worker checks cover simultaneous
text glyph output and recovery after killing a worker without changing settings.
Warning-free `-Werror` build and all 29 tests passed, GPU/monitoring checks enabled.

Next: exclude OBS global audio devices and mixer/track buses from scene imports;
expose deletion of existing mixer buses. Then implement the OBS filter suite and
source context-menu filter editing (add, edit, reorder, enable/disable, remove),
including Linux equivalents where available and no libOBS dependency. Filter
processing and editing are not currently implemented; retained OBS records alone
do not apply filters.

## Text font selector, 2026-10-21

Text source settings now list installed font families in the existing dropdown
control. The stored `font` setting and `Sans` default remain compatible with
existing sources and OBS imports. GUI checks click an installed font, save it and
reopen the dialog to verify the selection persists. Warning-free `-Werror` build;
all 29 tests passed with GPU and monitoring checks enabled.

## OBS groups and linked canvas tabs, 2026-10-21

ADR-0064 imports OBS groups as native group nodes inside their scenes, with saved
local bounds, transforms, cropping and fresh placement IDs. Underlying sources
remain shared; actual nested scenes remain scene references. CPU/GPU rendering and
UI transform handles use the saved bounds. Ungroup refuses bounded groups rather
than silently dropping their clipping; OBS export still reports groups converted
to nested scenes. Recursive expansion is capped before any project is written.

The obsolete `streamelements_transition_audio_wrapper_source` type is skipped at
both global and scene placements, with a report warning. Other unknown types keep
their placeholders. A temporary Marathon import produces 40 scenes, 17 native
group placements covering all eight group names, and no obsolete wrapper sources.
Existing collections are untouched: import again to receive these corrections.

Selecting a Scenes or Sources canvas tab activates its counterpart in the other
panel. Closed panels remain closed; when both panels share one tab group, the
clicked tab wins. Checks cover actual tab clicks, GUI OBS import and child
transforms, persistence, shared source identity, CPU/GPU rendering and import
limits. Validation: warning-free `-Werror` build and all 29 tests passed with GPU
and monitoring checks enabled.

## Combined video capture audio, 2026-10-21

ADR-0063 adds an Audio input selector to Video Capture creation/settings: None,
Default (matching capture device), and discovered recording inputs. New sources
default to matching the card through physical USB/PCI identity; missing or ambiguous
matches remain unavailable, never fall back to the system microphone. Explicit
inputs are verified before delivering samples and cannot move to another device.

The same source owns video and audio, shares its name and mixer controls, and
retains capture while off-scene unless deactivation is enabled. None removes its
mixer strip. New attached audio routes to Program; enabling audio on older sources
routes unassigned placements in the same undo step. Old sources without the setting
remain video-only, preserving separate audio inputs. Existing projects are not
automatically converted; remove redundant standalone input after enabling attached
audio to avoid doubling. OBS export reports attached audio as a conversion gap.

Validation includes real-renderer private audio sinks for capture, switching, None,
missing/default-unmatched inputs, hidden placements, deletion and legacy settings;
UI selector/mixer/undo checks; and read-only Elgato physical-device matching. Full
suite passes 29/29 with GPU and monitoring checks enabled, warning-free build.
Independent hardware clock drift and automatic video reconnect remain limitations.

## OBS canvas membership, 2026-10-20

ADR-0061 preserves extra OBS canvas identities and scene membership, using native
canvases instead of flattening/renaming their scenes. Consistent saved custom scene
sizes supply extra canvas geometry; missing geometry explicitly warns and uses the
supplied Main dimensions on a separate canvas. Conflicting or oversized geometry
is refused before writing. FPS inherits the operator-supplied rate with a report.
Each extra canvas gets its own deck, initialized to its first scene with a warning
because OBS canvas metadata does not save active scenes here.

A temporary Marathon reimport creates Main at 2560x1440, Aitum Vertical at 1080x1920
and Vertical at 2560x1440 with an explicit missing-geometry warning. The operator's
existing collection remains unchanged. Import checks save/reopen and render both
canvas paths, preserve source identity and verify independent Program selection.
Extra-canvas OBS export still uses the previously reported custom-size-scene
approximation and is separate follow-up work. Validation: warning-free `-Werror`
build and all 29 tests passed with GPU and monitoring checks enabled.

## Audio monitoring output, 2026-10-20

ADR-0060 adds an Audio Mixer footer selector for None, System default and discovered
PulseAudio/PipeWire output sinks. None is the default, including projects without
a saved output. Refresh updates the list; unavailable saved outputs remain visible.
The selection is undoable and persists in project settings. Named sinks do not fall
back or move to another output automatically. Changing output recreates only monitor
playback; None releases it without clearing source/bus monitor flags or changing the
program mix. Failed opens retry at a bounded rate.

The UI check clicks System default and None in a project containing only colors,
checks save/undo/redo and rejects unknown identities. An opt-in real-renderer audio
check (`LIBERTAS_TEST_MONITOR=1`) sends a media tone through two private null sinks,
verifies output switching and None, and rejects a missing output. It never routes
its test tone to the operator's speakers. Validation: warning-free `-Werror` build
and all 29 tests passed with GPU and monitoring checks enabled.

## Seven blend modes, 2026-10-20

ADR-0059 carries Normal, Add, Subtract, Screen, Multiply, Lighten and Darken through
one shared draw plan to CPU and GPU execution. Properties offers these seven modes;
Add retains the existing `linear-dodge` serialized name. OBS import/export maps all
seven. Non-Normal groups and explicitly isolated groups flatten before blending,
with opacity applied once. Blended sources retain canvas transform handles.

Native alpha uses source-over coverage in scene-linear RGB. OBS fixed-function
blending can differ for transparent layers, so conversion reports state this limit.
Unimplemented blend/effect combinations still report gaps. Real scene tests cover
all modes, alpha, opacity, transformed/nested groups, and OBS round trips. Validation:
warning-free `-Werror` build and all 29 tests passed with GPU checks enabled. The UI
check clicks each Properties option and verifies actual renderer pixels and handles.

## Plugin support investigation, 2026-10-20

The operator moved this investigation immediately after monitoring output, which
is implemented and pushed. Proposed ADR-0062 inventories actual worker transport,
OBS extension interfaces, Source Clone and Countdown dependencies. It recommends
native versioned contracts across control/UI/media, retaining no libobs and no
in-process native plugins. Countdown and clone/filter implementations should prove
the contracts before publishing an experimental SDK. Existing Qt docks and graphics
callbacks need adaptation; unchanged OBS binaries are not supported. Wasm, shader
manifests, plugin discovery and permission enforcement remain future implementation,
not existing capabilities. The ADR includes delivery gates and the full extension
surface: sources, filters, transitions, audio, encoders, outputs, services and tools.
The source/import fidelity backlog below remains pending where not marked complete.

## OBS collection fidelity backlog, 2026-10-19

The operator approved the following scope after reviewing the Marathon import. Its
40 OBS scenes and eight groups exist as 48 native scene files, with scene item
references retained. The remaining work concerns rendering, behavior and import
translation, rather than merely creating the collection. Original JSON and the
import report remain alongside the imported project.

1. **Native source cloning.** Use https://github.com/exeldro/obs-source-clone as a
   behavior reference; expose a native equivalent and translate OBS parameters.
   Review target source/scene/canvas, audio, active lifetime, buffering and filter
   inclusion. Six imported clones currently produce no picture/audio. Two target
   `Camera.SRC`, which is absent from the original collection: report unresolved
   targets and support explicit remapping rather than guessing a replacement.
2. **Stock filters.** Make OBS-equivalent filters available natively and translate
   their settings. This collection has six enabled image masks, 13 enabled color
   corrections and one enabled crop filter. Preserve disabled filters too,
   including luma key. Validate source, nested-scene and group filter behavior.
3. **Canvas mapping.** Reuse existing native vertical canvas support. Map OBS
   canvas identities, geometry and scene membership correctly; 14 Aitum scenes
   and one other vertical scene currently flatten onto Main. Do not infer missing
   canvas geometry silently.
4. **Blending.** Implement native blend modes in both render backends and import
   their settings. Screen and Multiply are used here. Normal remains standard
   alpha compositing, without an extra color blend operation. Preserve opacity,
   group isolation and color-space semantics.
5. **Media fidelity.** Resolve actual media dimensions before calculating imported
   placement; preserve aspect ratio and restart/keep-running behavior. Several
   sources explicitly disable restart on activation. Existing playback support
   does not make these imported settings equivalent.
6. **Text/group fidelity.** Audit existing support before adding features. Translate
   supported settings and fill actual gaps in text outline, shadow, wrapping and
   measurement. Repair missing bounds for `Live.Chat.Text.GRP`; groups already
   import as nested scenes.
7. **Stinger transitions.** Required: import and run the two file-backed stingers,
   with timing and audio behavior. The operator no longer uses StreamElements;
   ignore its four obsolete transition wrappers with a clear import report.
8. **Browser/audio behavior.** Preserve browser lifetime/settings where supported,
   review required OBS browser APIs, and prevent duplicate nested/shared audio.
   Add a monitoring-output selector in the audio panel. **None is the default**;
   offer system default and available sinks, including the operator's WaveSink
   system output and custom OBS monitoring sink when discovered. Never enable
   monitoring or select a sink by guessed name during import.

9. **Countdown timers.** Replicate the workflow of
   https://github.com/ashmanix/obs-plugin-countdown using native timers driving text
   sources. Inspect plugin configuration and controls before choosing the model;
   preserve multiple timer bindings and supported formatting/start/stop/reset behavior
   during import where saved plugin configuration is available. Existing countdown
   text alone is not evidence that timer automation was imported. The local plugin
   config is `~/.config/obs-studio/plugin_config/obs-plugin-countdown/config.json`,
   outside scene collection JSON. It contains two 15-minute timers bound to
   `START.CD.TXT` and `BRB.CD.TXT`; importing their automation needs that companion
   configuration. Review elapsed/target-time modes, formatting, end actions, color
   rules and hotkeys against the plugin before claiming full equivalence.

Capture rates must follow runtime device capabilities; a 60 fps canvas does not
require capture at 60 fps. Read-only V4L2 enumeration of the attached Elgato 4K X
reports 2560x1440 at 120 and 144 fps in NV12, YU12 and MJPEG, with no exact 119 or
165 fps mode at that resolution. YUYV, BGR3 and P010 advertise at most 60 fps at
1440p. These are advertised capabilities, not new streaming validation. Leave the
operator's saved capture settings unchanged. Review imported device identity and
timeouts separately from missing scene features; all 31 checked image/media/mask
file references exist.

For implementation, inspect existing model/render capabilities first, write an ADR
before model changes, drive real rendering/UI in regression checks, and commit and
push each successful section after a warning-free build and green suite. Keep CPU
fallback and GPU behavior aligned. Blend implementation status is recorded above; remaining sections are pending.

## Startup scene alignment, 2026-10-19

Initial scene selection now follows each canvas's saved Program scene. The saved show had
Screen in Program while startup selected the first scene, Elgato, so the viewport and Sources
panel disagreed. Opening a collection also restores selection from Program. Valid selections
during normal editing, including right-click selection, retain their existing behavior.

The headless check boots a real saved project with second-scene Program and first-scene Preview,
checks both canvases, opens it in the real GUI, and verifies scene highlighting, visible Sources,
Favourites and green pixels returned by the renderer. Alignment does not change the saved show.
Validation: warning-free -Werror build and all 29 tests passed with GPU checks enabled.

## Scene collection GUI, 2026-10-19

ADR-0058 enables every Scene Collection menu entry: New, Duplicate, Rename, Remove,
Import, Export, Project Problems and switching. New collections use the studio output defaults.
Current work is saved before switching, including initially unsaved sessions in managed storage.
An atomic catalog records names, paths and the last-open collection; --project overrides it.
Rename uses the document command and supports undo. Removal requires confirmation and uses
native Trash. Existing export paths are refused. Native copies preserve companion files and
absolute external media references; locks and journals are not copied.

Desktop portal choosers support OBS JSON/native directory import and both native/OBS export.
OBS import asks for canvas dimensions and rational FPS; conversion reports remain visible and
on disk. OBS export maps shared sources, scenes, nested groups and supported placements, with
explicit reports for unsupported effects, opacity, routing, device identities and profile settings.
Unsupported imported OBS plugin records can be restored for OBS to load. OBS profiles and
Libertas outputs are separate; credentials are never read. Editable sessions reject newer schemas.

Validation: warning-free -Werror build and 29/29 tests with GPU checks enabled. Real menu/dialog
checks cover rename, duplicate, new, both import/export formats, cancellation, native companion
files, failed switching, no-overwrite, Trash and catalog persistence. Exported cropped, flipped,
pivoted and rotated scenes reimport with identical rendered pixels. OBS itself and interactive
portal browsing have not been exercised for the new export workflow.

## Capture format and timeout controls, 2026-10-19

ADR-0057 exposes device-enumerated video formats, Use buffering, Autoreset on
timeout, and Frames until timeout. Defaults are Auto, buffering on, autoreset off,
and five frame periods; timeout integers must be 2–120. Auto retains the measured
format preference; capture logs now report the negotiated fourcc. Explicit format
selection must match the requested mode. MJPEG decoding uses installed FFmpeg;
raw conversion includes YV12 and SDR P010 when the device reports them. HDR remains
unsupported. OBS import preserves these four settings.

Buffering uses the bounded V4L2 queue. Disabling it drains older queued frames
before conversion. Timeout uses negotiated FPS and monotonic time; autoreset
stops, requeues and restarts the stream. Physical unplug/reconnect is separate and
unsupported. Hardware checks produced frames in all six Elgato formats at
1080p30, with buffering both enabled and disabled, and retained 1440p60 capture
and off-scene lifetime coverage. A physical signal-loss timeout reset has not
been exercised on this hardware.
Validation: warning-free `-Werror` build, 29/29 suite and both hardware-enabled
video/preview tests passed. Real UI clicks save both checkboxes and the integer
timeout. Source checkbox rows now have explicit click-area dimensions.
Shared checkbox layout anchors text six pixels after its square, avoiding overlap
from the former Row layout. UI checks assert this spacing for all three capture flags.

## Video capture stays ready, 2026-10-19

ADR-0056 starts configured V4L2 capture devices when the project loads, even if
their scenes have never been shown. Devices keep streaming off scene and publish
the latest frame, so switching back reuses capture without reopening the device.
The source settings expose "Deactivate when not showing", disabled by default.
Hidden capture updates do not trigger composites. Removing a source, changing its
capture mode or exiting the renderer releases the device. Changing only the
deactivation setting preserves a visible session.

The real-renderer hardware check exercises startup without an active scene,
repeated scene switches, opt-in deactivation, and hidden-source removal. It checks
device descriptors and requires a complete first composite on returning.
Validation: warning-free `-Werror` build, 29/29 suite, and both hardware-enabled
video/preview tests passed with the attached Elgato at 2560x1440@60.

## Scene clicks activate Program, 2026-10-19

ADR-0055 makes left-clicking a scene in Scenes or Favourites activate Program
immediately on that scene's canvas. Preview and Take are not required. Right-click
still selects for context actions; internal selection APIs remain selection-only.
Repeated clicks on the active scene add no undo entry.

Secondary canvases acquire an undoable, journaled deck on first activation. Canvas
removal includes its decks in the existing atomic removal command. The UI self-check
clicks real scene rows, verifies rendered colors, checks activation undo and verifies
that a secondary-canvas favourite leaves Main's Program unchanged. Command tests
cover deck lifecycle undo/redo and journal serialization.

## Preview cadence correction, 2026-10-19

ADR-0054 coalesces busy preview ticks into one refresh sent on acknowledgment,
without a growing queue or another full timer wait. Qt uses precise timer ticks.
Decoded pixels transfer into QImage ownership, removing one full-image copy while
keeping previously published images immutable. Unchanged-source skipping remains.

Live screen-capture profiling at a 2280x1282 preview found GPU work mostly 4-9 ms
and request round trips reaching 66-95 ms. CPU samples were dominated by copying.
Before/after samples measured average preview round trips of 12.31/11.07 ms;
these are sequential live observations, not a controlled benchmark or latency guarantee.
The operator reports noticeably smoother motion. A post-change panel sample showed
7.15 ms average rendering and zero overruns over 908 renders since reset.
Temporary stage probes were removed. The UI check stresses busy refreshes, preserves
an old image across a new rendered frame, and verifies stopping leaves no backlog.

## Render-lag accounting correction, 2026-10-19

ADR-0053 replaces UI busy-request ticks with renderer-measured composite overruns.
Preview protocol v6 carries cumulative per-canvas missed budgets alongside render
time and completed frames. Each composite contributes `max(0, ceil(duration / period) - 1)`;
the period uses that canvas's rational FPS. Reset baselines all three counters.
Audio work, transport, delayed acknowledgments, UI dispatch and unchanged capture
frames no longer masquerade as render lag. This measures composite overruns;
it does not claim to measure end-to-end preview or output delivery deadlines.

## Output groups and defaults, 2026-10-19

ADR-0052 makes Output Manager one named group per encode, with destinations nested
under that group's settings. The Outputs dock still lists individual destinations.
Adding a destination reuses the encode; removing a destination keeps its encode;
removing a group removes both in one undo step. The manager remains movable and resizable.

Global encoder presets support save, explicit replacement, apply, and delete. They
store encoder settings and rescale dimensions in `encoder-presets.json` under the
application config directory, excluding destination identities, URLs and credentials.
Applying a preset leaves canvas geometry and destinations intact. Invalid libraries
are refused without overwriting their contents. Existing projects retain their settings.

New UI sessions include Main canvas, Main Output encode and one disabled destination.
Adding a canvas offers horizontal 1920x1080 or vertical 1080x1920 at 60 fps, with its own
encode and destination. Both default to x264 H.264, 6000 kbps CBR, 2-second keyframes,
medium CPU preset, Main profile, Film tune, and custom buffer disabled (6000 retained).
Audio defaults to AAC 160 kbps, track 1, VOD track 0. Built-in presets downscale larger
canvases to the matching 1080 resolution without upscaling smaller canvases.
Encoding/output integration remains separate work; these controls configure intended output.
The warning-free `-Werror` build and all 29 tests pass with `LIBERTAS_TEST_GPU=1`.
Real UI checks cover shared destinations, preset controls and persistence, option validation,
new-session defaults, 4K downscaling, and canvas choices refreshed after adding a canvas.

## Source expansion and performance pass, 2026-10-19

The GPU, render statistics and Elgato work below is the validated baseline for this pass.
The warning-free `-Werror` build and all 26 tests passed again before the baseline commit.
Next: measure and reduce render costs, finish Linux source backends and their transform menus,
then import OBS scene collections. Commit and push each validated section. macOS-only sources
are excluded at the operator's request; use Linux equivalents where available.

### OBS importer and source coverage

ADR-0048 adds `libertas import-obs collection.json new-directory width height fps-num fps-den`.
The destination must not exist. Original JSON and a durable conversion report accompany the native
project. UUID references, source sharing, scene order, visibility/locks, quarter turns, flips, crops,
bounds and audio buses are converted. OBS groups become nested scenes with saved tight dimensions.
Name-only main-scene selection respects OBS's main-canvas UUID, so an Aitum scene with the same
name cannot replace program. Extra-canvas scenes are imported on the supplied canvas with warnings.

The local `Untitled.json` converted into `~/Shows/OBS-Imported-20261019.libertas`, using the OBS
profile's 2560x1440 at 60/1 fps. It contains two scenes and three sources; reopening and the project
inspector report no problems. Original OBS files and the existing demo projects remain intact.
Tests create/reopen real projects, render imported colors/images/groups, check cropped/flipped and
centered rotated placement, drive the actual CLI, and reject malformed references, cycles, duplicate
keys, excessive nesting and existing destinations. The warning-free `-Werror` build and expanded
suite pass 29/29 with GPU checks enabled.

Import requires operator review: capture identities, text layout, media output size, filters,
non-quarter rotations, crop-to-bounds and extra canvases may differ. Source records retain their
original settings. Transitions use Cut; hotkeys and output configuration are not converted.
Repeated audio placements can sum, including global audio in nested scenes; review routes.
The first importer is a CLI command, not an in-app import dialog.

Linux source coverage now includes audio input/output, color, image, text, slideshow, media,
playlist (VLC equivalent), browser, screen, window/game, V4L2 video, scene and transformed group.
Blackmagic has an isolated optional adapter and explicit unavailable-device behavior; real hardware
acquisition remains unverified. Only progressive SDR modes are accepted. Capture uses Hyprland's
native protocols; a portable portal fallback and cross-device GPU capture remain separate work.
Encoding/output integration remains separate from preview rendering and the audio mixer.

### Measured capture optimization

`perf` identified swscale's horizontal scaler as the dominant capture cost. At 2560x1440,
an isolated 300-frame conversion measured NV12-to-BGRA at 7.80 ms, planar YUV420-to-BGRA
at 1.19 ms, and BGR24-to-BGRA at 0.80 ms. Prefer YUV420, retaining the same USB bandwidth
as NV12 and preserving NV12 as a fallback. The real Elgato negotiated YU12 and sustained
59.39 fps with immutable leased frames; live renderer cycle samples over ten seconds fell
from 25.6 billion to 10.9 billion. These include capture and rendering and are not latency.

The repeatable `LIBERTAS_TEST_GPU=1 LIBERTAS_BENCHMARK=1` GPU test measures 1440p host upload,
4K composite and 640-edge preview readback: 7.32 ms/frame while the live show is also running.
A guarded 32-bit shader division experiment measured 7.18 ms, insufficient evidence to keep
extra branching; exact existing shader arithmetic remains. Larger gains need profiling the
host upload path separately from the GPU-only screen path.

### Native visual sources

ADR-0045 adds the isolated `libertas-source` worker. Text uses Qt font shaping and rasterization;
slideshows decode an ordered list of images; media and playlists use Qt's FFmpeg backend;
browser pages use sandboxed Qt WebEngine. The worker publishes straight RGBA through the existing
preview transport, and both compositors consume the same source snapshots. Explicit output
dimensions drive editor handles and placement. Text and playlist fields support multiple lines.

Worker checks assert real glyph pixels and transparency, changing slides, decoded moving video
and local HTML colours. CPU and GPU renderer-process checks verify text placement. Browser
rendering currently uses software frames and a host upload; profile before adding GPU sharing.
Sources restart when reactivated. Browser and media audio routing is not yet implemented.
Qt Multimedia and Qt WebEngine development packages are additional build requirements.

### Window and game capture

Window and Game Capture use `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1` plus
`ext_foreign_toplevel_image_capture_source_manager_v1`. The selector displays title and app ID
while storing the exact window identity. Closing and reopening an application requires selecting
its new identity. Dimensions come from the compositor and cursor preference is honored. A
stopped window session clears the old frame and retries at one-second intervals, including
size renegotiation. On this Hyprland session, both CPU and GPU process checks captured a real
2536x1390 window and verified shared snapshots across direct/nested placements. Game Capture
uses this same native window path; it is not an injected game graphics hook.

### Audio input/output and media PCM

ADR-0046 adds native PulseAudio/PipeWire capture and protocol v5 meter/PCM messages. Real Elgato
audio acquisition passed a 48 kHz stereo PCM check. A real worker/renderer check decodes a tone
and observes both source and program-bus levels. Media audio now reaches the renderer mixer;
the earlier visual-worker note describes that section before audio integration.
Source meters are pre-fader; bus meters reflect gain, mute and pan. Source/bus sends and local
Monitor controls operate on PCM. Browser audio uses a private temporary sound-server sink,
with a real Web Audio oscillator check verifying PCM reaches the parent. Encoder output remains
separate work. Blackmagic's optional native adapter runs in the source worker and uses vendor
API declarations with their original license; the absent-driver path is tested, but there is no
Blackmagic driver or hardware here to validate acquisition. Its explicit mode must be supported;
automatic format detection and HDR are not implemented.
The expanded suite passes 28/28; the additional real Elgato PCM and browser oscillator checks
also pass. The build remains warning-free with `-Werror`.

## Video capture update, 2026-10-18

### Group placement

ADR-0047 makes transformed groups use the shared scene plan on CPU and GPU. Groups expose
canvas-sized transform handles; child selection and drag coordinates follow ancestor groups.
Identity groups retain their existing pass-through behavior. Transformed contents clip to the
owning canvas; automatic tight bounds are deferred. Ungrouping a transformed group is refused
until its transform is reset, so placement cannot silently change. Pixel, GPU parity and real
UI interaction checks pass; the warning-free build and full suite pass 28/28.

Source cropping now trims sampled pixels on both CPU and GPU, rather than squeezing the whole
picture into cropped geometry. A red/green/blue strip check retains only green, and GPU parity
checks cover cropped captures with every quarter turn and flip. Full suite remains 28/28.

ADR-0044 adds `source.v4l2` capture through native V4L2 streaming and libswscale BGRA
conversion. Add **Video Capture**, select a device, resolution and frame rate. Stable
device paths exclude metadata nodes. Explicit modes fail instead of silently downgrading.
CPU and GPU consume the same leased snapshot through the shared scene walk; duplicate
placements cannot observe different capture frames within a render commit.

The attached Elgato 4K X negotiated **2560x1440 at 60/1 fps**. The real capture-thread check
measured **59.39 fps over 181 frames**, including BGRA conversion, while retaining an older
frame and verifying it remained immutable. Real renderer-process checks passed with both
CPU and RTX 2070 GPU backends, including direct and nested placements. These measurements
describe acquisition, not end-to-end latency or sustained 4K canvas throughput.
The build is warning-free with `LIBERTAS_WERROR=ON`; all 26 CTest entries pass with
`LIBERTAS_TEST_GPU=1`, including the headless UI check.

This slice supports raw SDR NV12, YUYV, YUV420 and RGB/BGR24. Audio, compressed-only devices,
HDR, automatic reconnect and USB zero-copy remain unimplemented. libswscale development
files are now a build dependency. Hardware checks run sequentially because capture is exclusive:

```sh
LIBERTAS_TEST_VIDEO=/dev/video2 build-make/tests/unit/test_video
LIBERTAS_RENDER_BACKEND=cpu LIBERTAS_TEST_VIDEO=/dev/video2 build-make/tests/unit/test_preview
LIBERTAS_RENDER_BACKEND=gpu LIBERTAS_TEST_VIDEO=/dev/video2 build-make/tests/unit/test_preview
```

## GPU render path update, 2026-10-18

ADR-0042 and its implementation were developed from `main` at `57ce881` and are included
in the validated baseline described above. The earlier clean-tree statement below describes
the CPU handoff. `AGENTS.md` was already untracked before the GPU work.

- `lcomp::plan_canvas` is the one scene walk. CPU and Vulkan execute its resolved operations;
  transparent precomps, source availability, gaps, placement and ordering are shared.
- `lrhi::GpuCompositor` composites at canvas size in scene-linear RGBA16F. A separate GPU pass
  produces sRGB8 at the requested preview size; only that reduced buffer is read back.
- Capture publishes leased dmabuf slots. A render commit holds one snapshot per connector
  across repeated placements, nested scenes and canvases. Capture threads do no Vulkan work.
- Preview protocol v2 carries a maximum preview edge. QML reports its physical display size;
  refresh-only commits reuse the document and unchanged frames receive only an Ack. The UI
  retains its last image on that Ack. This also fixes the old freshness skip: timer ticks used
  to resend the document and mark it changed every time.
- Offscreen runs use CPU. Normal runs try Vulkan, log failure, and fall back to CPU. Set
  `LIBERTAS_RENDER_BACKEND=cpu` or `gpu` to force a backend; `gpu` fails instead of silently
  falling back. `LIBERTAS_RENDER_DEVICE=226:128` selects by DRM device identity (`226:129` is
  Intel here). Cross-device capture is explicitly refused until validated.

### Evidence and checks

The original suite passed 24/24 before changes. The expanded suite passes 25/25 when hardware
checks are enabled with `LIBERTAS_TEST_GPU=1`; without that variable the GPU test is skipped.
The real process check also runs with a required GPU. Hardware parity checks pass on both RTX
2070 and Intel UHD 630, including rotations, flips, opacity, nested scenes and reduced preview.
CPU retains its sRGB8 intermediate rounding; GPU retains half-float linear intermediates. The
tested scenes allow at most two byte values of channel error, not a universal bound for an
arbitrary number of translucent layers.

Real captures on HDMI-A-1 and HDMI-A-2 pass pixel comparison and Vulkan synchronization
validation. Repeated rendering of one captured frame, including a 640-edge preview readback,
measured **1.30 ms at 2560x1440** and **1.87 ms at 3840x2160**, averaged over 60 frames.
The final 4K run with producer-fence waiting and synchronization validation measured 1.67 ms.
These are composite/readback timings, **not sustained capture throughput**. A separate real
process check keeps capture running and verifies direct and repeated nested placements read
identical snapshots. An unavailable DRM device also passes the CPU fallback process check.

### What follows this slice

Encode/output integration is still absent. The full-size linear target stays in the render
process, but an encoder handoff API is not exposed yet. ADR-0019's converted host-memory
transfer to a secondary encoder still needs integration and measurement. Cross-device capture
is rejected rather than assumed to work. A timed-out GPU fence terminates the render process
without recycling potentially live resources; automatic device-loss recovery still belongs to
the future supervisor/output work. The decoded-image upload path currently uploads each drawn
image per composite; profile a real image-heavy show before adding a texture cache.

## Previous CPU handoff

Written 2026-10-18, at the end of a session that got a real screen drawing in the Program panel
and then went looking for why it is slow. Read this before picking the work up elsewhere.

## The state of the tree right now

`main` is at `8731e1c`, pushed, **and the working tree is clean**. Everything this session
produced is committed: the benchmark instrumentation has been stripped, the build is
warning-free under `-Werror`, and the suite is 24/24.

The app was launched after the final commit to confirm capture still opens and the composite
idles at 0% CPU on a static screen.

## What landed and is pushed

Four commits put a live screen on the canvas, in this order:

- `2c31475` — ADR-0041, a screen source stores the connector it captures (`output`, e.g.
  `DP-1`). `libs/lcapture` became a real library holding the measured `wlcap` backend.
- `9253c37` — `composite_canvas` gained a `FrameSource` overload, so the scene walk can draw a
  frame it is handed without `lcomp` owning a device.
- `77cb1de` — the Vulkan device moved from `tools/spike-core` to `libs/lrhi`, where ADR-0005
  always said the GPU lives. Moved, not rewritten, so ADR-0011's measurements still describe it.
- `8accff2` — the two halves connected. Verified on this machine: RTX 2070, Hyprland, a real
  desktop in the Program panel.
- `6c54750` — removed six self-check assertions that were measuring event-loop passes rather
  than layout, and split the capture budget into a first-frame wait and a later-frame wait.
- `ee69359` — the blit was doing four million integer divisions a frame. See "The problem that
  was open" below.
- `cb03a51` — this document, with the CPU cost table and the GPU brief.
- `8731e1c` — the four operator-reported fixes, the screen dropdown, the live preview timer and
  the performance work. The section below is its shape.

## What landed in the last commit (`8731e1c`)

All committed. Listed because the commit is large and this is the shape of it.

**Four operator-reported fixes:**

1. **The transform menu works on any source with a rectangle.** `placed_map` in
   `apps/libertas-ui/document.cpp` was listing drawable types by name, so only a colour or an
   image could be selected on the canvas. It now asks whether the node has a natural size. A
   screen's natural size is its monitor's resolution, read from the compositor and cached for
   half a second (`screens_now()`).
2. **Shift is inverted.** Aspect is locked by default; Shift frees it. A source is a picture
   with a shape of its own, and distorting it should be the gesture you ask for. Alt is
   unchanged. The self-check asserts both directions.
3. **Edge snapping, 12 screen pixels**, to canvas edges and centre lines. Screen pixels rather
   than canvas units so the feel does not change with zoom. Works with the aspect locked: the
   other axis is recomputed from the ratio rather than distorting.
4. **A screen dropdown.** `source.screen`'s `output` field is now a `choice` filled at runtime
   from `libertas::capture::list_screens()`. The UI asks the compositor directly — listing
   outputs is a registry read, not a capture, so it needs no GPU and no session.

**Two bugs found by the self-check while making those**, both mine, both fixed: Alt was
recentring per-axis so the rectangle drifted, and a snapped edge under Alt moved without its
opposite number (11px off centre).

**The settings-dialog preview for a screen** now shows the chosen monitor's connector,
resolution and refresh instead of "no pipeline attached". Not live pixels: that would open a
second capture session for a source that may be cancelled.

**The preview republishes on a timer while a live source is on the canvas.** It previously
published only on `Document::changed`, which is why capture produced one frame and then a still
picture. The rate is the canvas's own `fps`, not the monitor's. `Document::hasLiveSource()`
decides, and states the live types rather than the still ones so an unknown type from a later
build defaults to still.

**Six performance changes**, each one measured:

| Change | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Capture moved to its own thread, waiting unbounded | ADR-0013 Consequence 4: a bounded wait must never be used to sample. The old code waited 120 ms per tick and returned nothing — an 8 fps ceiling regardless of the screen |
| `CapturedPicture` borrows rather than owns | Two 33 MB copies per frame at 4K, 2.6 ms each, against 1.6 ms for the scaling they fed |
| BGRA→RGBA folded into the sampler (`swap_rb`) | A separate pass over the whole buffer measured 5.1 ms a frame at 4K, converting pixels that were about to be scaled away |
| `srgb_to_linear` replaced by an exact 256-entry table | `std::pow` per channel per pixel measured 110 ms on a 1080p frame. Exact, not approximate — the table is filled from the same function |
| Decoded images cached on path + mtime + size | A still was re-decoded every composite. Fine when composites only happened on edit; not at 60 fps |
| `sample_axis` precomputed per axis instead of per pixel | Two `idiv` instructions were 68% of the blit. 35 ms composite to 5.3 ms. See below |
| Composites skipped when no new frame and no document change | A 30 Hz screen on a 60 fps canvas has nothing new half the time |

## The problem that was open, and its answer

**It was integer division, and `perf` named it in one run.**

The composite took ~35 ms, of which the blit was 33 ms, while a faithful standalone
reproduction of the same blit ran in 1.16 ms. Six hypotheses had been advanced and eliminated
before a profiler was available. The profile settled it immediately:

```
93.75%  libertas-render  [.] lcomp::blit(...)
```

and annotating that symbol:

```
36.87 :  2f680:  idiv   %rbx
31.09 :  2f648:  idiv   %r9
 7.70 :  2f6b3:  movzbl 0x3(%r9),%eax
```

**Two `idiv` instructions, 68% of all samples.** `sample_axis` does a 64-bit integer division,
and the blit called it once per axis per pixel: at 1920x1080 that is 4.1 million divisions a
frame. 64-bit `idiv` is 20-40 cycles on this core and does not pipeline, so it dominated
everything else in the loop.

Why the standalone benchmark did not show it: the benchmark's inner loop was simple enough that
the compiler hoisted the `y` division out of it. The real blit could not, because the branch
choosing between the straight path and the rotate/flip cases kept both divisions inside.
**That is the lesson worth keeping — the benchmark was not wrong about the code, it was wrong
about the loop the compiler would build.**

### The fix

`axis_map()` in `libs/lcomp/src/composite.cpp` precomputes the source index for every
destination row and column, once per blit, using `sample_axis` itself so the arithmetic is
identical and the picture does not change. A 4K-to-1080p blit now does about 3000 divisions
instead of 4.1 million.

Built only for the straight path. A quarter turn reads the other axis of the source for each
destination axis, so its four cases would each need their own pair; they are left on the
per-pixel path until a profile says otherwise.

### What it bought, measured

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| composite (walk) | 35.1 ms | 5.3 ms |
| of which blit | 33.0 ms | 4.9 ms |
| of which image source | 2.1 ms | 0.4 ms |
| render process CPU | 78% | 53% |

The image source got faster too, because it goes through the same blit.

### What is left, and whether it matters

A re-profile after the fix shows no single hotspot: the time is spread across the pixel loop
(the heaviest instruction is a 12% load of the source alpha byte), which is what a memory-bound
blit is supposed to look like. There is no second `idiv`-shaped mistake hiding behind the first.

53% CPU for 5.3 ms of work per composite is the composite running at the canvas's 60 fps while
the captured screen only produces 30. The freshness skip added this session should cover that
and does not appear to be firing as often as it should — **that is the next thing to look at,
and it is cheap**: `Screens::anything_new()` in `apps/libertas-render/main.cpp` and the
`document_changed` flag in `libs/lcomp/src/preview.cpp`.

### Method note

The six earlier hypotheses (memory copying, `std::pow`, image decode, cold GPU memory,
optimisation flags, the wrong `blit`) were all reasonable and all wrong. A profiler answered in
one run what reasoning had not in several hours. Two practical notes for next time:

- `pgrep -f libertas-render` matches the shell wrappers as well as the process. Use
  `pgrep -f 'build-make/apps/libertas-render'`, and check the pid is stable before recording.
- `timeout 15 perf record ...` SIGKILLs perf before it writes its data, giving "no samples".
  Use `perf record ... -- sleep 10`, which lets perf terminate normally.

## What the CPU path costs, measured 2026-10-18

Run on this machine: RTX 2070, Hyprland, capturing HDMI-A-2 (3840x2160 @ 30 Hz), one screen
source plus one image source in the program scene.

| | 1080p canvas (4K downscaled) | 4K canvas (1:1) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alloc + clear | 0.78 ms | 3.3 ms |
| blit | 4.9 ms | 18.4 ms |
| total walk | 5.3 ms | 21.4 ms |
| render CPU | 53% | 53% |
| sustained | comfortable at 30 | **~10 fps** |

A 1080p preview of a 4K screen is fine: 5.3 ms a composite leaves plenty of room at 30 Hz, and
the CPU figure is the composite running faster than the source produces rather than the blit
struggling.

Compositing 4K one-to-one is **~10 fps**, and that is the honest ceiling of this path. The blit
is 18.4 ms for 8.3 million pixels, which is about 2.2 ns a pixel -- memory-bound, no single hot
instruction left (the post-fix profile is 46% blit with the time spread across the loop rather
than concentrated). It is not a bug to be found; it is what a single-threaded scalar copy of
33 MB per frame costs.

The operator's position on this, recorded so it is not relitigated: **4K on an integrated GPU or
a CPU fallback at 10 fps is acceptable.** This path exists for machines without a usable device
and for the headless self-check. It is not the path a show runs on.

### What would make the CPU path faster, if it ever needs to be

Not done, and not currently justified. Listed so the options are known rather than rediscovered:

- **Thread the blit by destination rows.** It is embarrassingly parallel and there are 16 cores.
  Probably 4-6x on this machine.
- **SIMD the inner copy.** The straight path moves four bytes with a channel swap; that is a
  shuffle, and at 8.3 million pixels it would matter.
- **Composite at preview resolution, not canvas resolution.** The Program panel is a few hundred
  pixels tall. Compositing 4K to show it in a 400px box is most of the cost, and the encode path
  will want the full-size composite anyway -- so this is really "the preview should ask for the
  size it will draw".

The third is the one that would help a real show, and it belongs with the GPU work rather than
before it.

## The next phase: the GPU path

**This is the work to start next.** The CPU path is now as good as it needs to be for what it is
(see the section above), and the GPU path was always the intended one -- the operator's words:
*the GPU route is being built regardless; CPU was never the goal except as the fallback for a
machine without a GPU.*

### Where to start reading

- `docs/adr/0005` — six process roles. `libertas-render` owns the GPU. This is the ADR that
  settles where the device lives, and it has said so since the start.
- `docs/adr/0006` — the composite-to-encode handoff: scene-linear RGBA16F on a `VkDevice`.
- `docs/adr/0040` — why the preview is a separate process, and its last consequence, which is
  the constraint this phase has to respect.
- `docs/adr/0011`, `0019` — what was measured about capture and dual-GPU encode. The code those
  numbers describe is now in `libs/lrhi` and `libs/lcapture`, moved rather than rewritten.

### What is already built and working

- `libs/lrhi` owns a Vulkan device: instance and device creation, dmabuf export and import,
  readback to host memory, and a BGRA→NV12 compute pass hooked in from the encode spike.
- `libs/lcapture` captures a named screen into a ring of client-allocated dmabufs, on its own
  thread, blocking until the compositor delivers. Verified: 3840x2160 AR24 on an RTX 2070.
- `libertas-render` already opens the device, lazily, on the first screen source.
- `libs/lcomp` walks the scene and composites on the CPU, which is the fallback and the thing
  the headless self-check drives.

### The constraint that shapes everything

ADR-0040's last consequence, verbatim:

> The software picture must not grow into a second compositor that disagrees with the GPU one.
> When `lrhi` exists, the scene walk is the part worth sharing. A blend mode, a rotation or a
> capture implemented only here would be the disagreement.

`lrhi` now exists. So the first real decision is **not** "how do we draw on the GPU" but **"what
do the two backends share"**. The likely shape: the walk produces a list of draw operations --
source, rect, opacity, quarter turn, flips -- and the CPU and GPU backends each consume that
list. Two walks that happen to agree today will not agree in six months.

### The decisions ADR-0042 has to make

1. **The shared walk.** What the walk emits, and what a backend is. This constrains everything
   after it, so it comes first.
2. **Where the captured frame stops being a dmabuf.** Today it is read back to host memory for
   the CPU walk. On the GPU path it should stay on the device from capture through composite to
   encode, and the readback should happen only for the preview, at preview size.
3. **Preview size versus canvas size.** The Program panel is a few hundred pixels tall and the
   composite is currently full canvas resolution. The encode path wants full size; the preview
   does not. Deciding this well is most of the CPU path's remaining cost too.
4. **What happens with no usable device.** The CPU path stays, because the self-check runs
   offscreen and some machines have no GPU. Both paths must stay correct, which is the argument
   for one walk.
5. **The dual-GPU case.** This machine has an Intel UHD 630 alongside the RTX 2070 — exactly
   ADR-0019's subject. `vk_create_exportable` already carries a `host_memory` flag for the
   system-RAM round trip a second GPU needs. None of the current capture path is tested across
   two devices.

### A suggested order

1. Write ADR-0042 for the shared walk. Code after, per the repo rule.
2. Keep the frame on the device: capture → GPU composite → readback at preview size only.
3. Then the encode half, which has measured code waiting in `tools/spike-core`.

### Before writing any code, read this

The repo rules that bit hardest this session:

- **Model changes need an ADR before code.** ADR-0042 is next.
- **Non-trivial behaviour gets a self-check assertion that drives the real thing**, not the
  function behind it. The GPU path cannot be driven by the offscreen check, which is exactly why
  the CPU path has to stay correct and checked.
- **Builds are warning-free under `-Werror` and the suite is green before a commit.**
- **Measure before changing.** Six reasoned hypotheses about the composite were all wrong this
  session; one `perf` run found the answer. `perf` is installed now.

## Things deliberately left undone, with reasons

- **`showCursor` and `pauseWhenHidden` are stored and ignored.** The cursor is always captured;
  nothing stops capturing when a source is off screen.
- **Nothing checks panel geometry in the scene graph.** Six assertions did and were removed in
  `6c54750` — they measured event-loop passes, not layout. `test_layout`, `test_dropzone` and
  `test_layout_serialize` cover the engine without a window.
- **The first-frame and later-frame capture budgets (3 s and 120 ms) are guesses from one
  machine.** The slow case is the untested one. Note that the later-frame budget is now moot on
  the threaded path, which waits unbounded; the first-frame wait still matters.
- **No portal backend in `lcapture`.** `linux-portal/` is still an empty directory; the portal
  code remains in `tools/spike-core`. It stays the fallback (ADR-0011) and is what would fill
  `output` in from the picker's `mapping_id`.
- **What happens when a named connector is gone** is undecided (ADR-0041). It is a running-show
  failure and belongs with a supervisor that does not exist yet.
- **"Fit to screen" bakes a layout box at the canvas size it was used on.** Changing the canvas
  afterwards leaves the node drawing at the old size, because `fit: natural` then resolves
  against the stored box rather than the source. Hit while benchmarking: a canvas changed to 4K
  kept compositing its source at 1920x1080, which looked like a bug in the canvas resize and was
  not. Whether a fit should re-resolve when the canvas changes is a real question and nobody has
  answered it.
