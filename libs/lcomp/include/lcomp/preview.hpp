///   Project  u8 kind, u32 length, one memfd of `project_to_json`. Resets the assembly.
///   Scene    u8 kind, u32 length, one memfd of `scene_to_json`.
///   Commit   u8 kind, u32 maximum preview edge (0 = full size). Reuse the last snapshot
///            on refresh; Ack alone means no document, capture or size change.
///   Quit     u8 kind. The renderer exits.
///   Frame    u8 kind, 26-byte canvas id, u32 width, u32 height, u32 stride, u8 status,
///            u32 gap count, u64 cumulative render ns, u64 completed frames,

///            carries one memfd of tightly packed straight sRGB8. Later frames of the same
///            size reuse it: the client copies on receipt, and it does not send another
///            snapshot until it has copied, so the renderer is not writing what is being read.
///   Ack      u8 kind. One per commit, after that commit's frames. The client may send again.
///   Fault    u8 kind, the rest UTF-8. Something about the snapshot could not be drawn at all.
///            An ack still follows, or the client would wait forever.
///   Audio    u8 kind, u32 count, then node/bus ULID, u32 left/right peaks in millionths,
///            u8 availability. Sent even when a video refresh only produces an Ack.
///   Pcm      u8 kind, source ULID, interleaved stereo float32 little-endian at 48 kHz.
