/// The command bus.
///
/// Every document mutation is one of these: validated, serialisable, journalable and undoable.
/// The UI, global hotkeys, a Stream Deck, a websocket API and scripting are then all the same
/// thing -- producers of commands -- rather than five code paths that each mutate the document
/// slightly differently and disagree about undo.
///
/// Two properties make the rest of the system fall out of this one:
///
/// **Applying a command returns its inverse, and the inverse is itself a command.** Undo is
/// therefore not a separate mechanism with its own bugs; it is the same apply() running a command
/// that was built from the state the first one replaced. It also means an undo step can be
/// written to the journal exactly like anything else.
///
/// **A command that cannot be applied changes nothing.** Every one validates before it mutates,
/// so a refused command leaves the project byte-identical rather than half-applied.
