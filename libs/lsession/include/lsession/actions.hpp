/// Actions, and what is bound to them.
///
/// An action is **data**: an id, a title, a scope and a default trigger. That is the decision
/// ADR-0024 records, and the reason is that everything else about hotkeys follows from where the
/// scope is written down. Declared per action, as a field, scope can later become user-editable
/// by adding an override map. Hard-coded into two dispatch mechanisms, it could not.
///
/// Both scopes end in the same place -- an `ldoc::Command` sent to the same `Session` -- and
/// differ only in who delivers the trigger:
///
/// - **Application** actions are handled by the UI's own key handling and never touch the portal.
///   Undo, delete, rename. Making them global would be actively harmful: Ctrl+Z firing while the
///   operator types in a browser.
/// - **Global** actions are declared to `org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts` and must keep
///   working when the UI is dead, which is one of Phase 1's own acceptance tests. The portal
///   session therefore belongs to the session process, not the frontend.
