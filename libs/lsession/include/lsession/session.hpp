/// The boundary between whoever is editing a document and whoever owns it.
///
/// ADR-0005 puts the document in `libertas-session` and gives the UI **zero authority** over it.
/// That process split is not built yet, and this interface is what makes building it later a
/// change of transport rather than a rewrite: today `LocalSession` owns the document in the same
/// process, and tomorrow a proxy over `lipc` implements the same five operations by talking to
/// another one.
///
/// Three rules keep that promise, and they are rules about the *caller*, not the implementation:
///
/// 1. **Nothing outside here may hold a mutable Project.** Reading is a const reference;
///    writing is `run()`. A caller that reaches around this is a caller that stops compiling the
///    day the document moves to another process.
///
/// 2. **Update from the notification, never from the return value of `run()`.** `run()` returns
///    an error for the operator to read, nothing more. Over a socket it may one day return
///    before the command has been applied, and a UI that repaints on the return value would then
///    repaint too early. One that repaints on the notification does not change at all.
///
/// 3. **Errors are values.** Nothing throws across this boundary, because one day it is a
///    boundary exceptions cannot cross.
