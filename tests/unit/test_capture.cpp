// What a capture test can honestly assert without a screen.
//
// The suite runs headless, over SSH, on a box with no RTX card. Real capture needs a live Wayland
// compositor with ext-image-copy-capture-v1 bound, so nothing here claims a frame arrived -- that
// is `capture-spike`'s job, on a machine with a display, and it reports numbers rather than a
// green tick. ADR-0013 names the trap directly: a capture check that cannot tell a still screen
// from a broken path reports success on both.
//
// What is ours, and is covered here, is choosing which screen a source means (ADR-0041).
